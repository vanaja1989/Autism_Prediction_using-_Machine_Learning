# Autism_Prediction_using-_Machine_Learning
The autism prediction project uses machine learning to help determine the chances of someone having autism spectrum disorder (ASD) by looking at various pieces of information about them. Our goal is to build a model that uses past data and sophisticated analysis to support early diagnosis and intervention. By applying these advanced techniques, we hope to improve the accuracy of diagnoses, assist healthcare providers, and ultimately lead to better support and outcomes for those who might be at risk for autism.
Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is a developmental condition that influences how individuals communicate, behave, and interact with others. Recognizing and diagnosing ASD early on is essential for providing timely support and effective interventions. However, diagnosing ASD can be quite challenging. The symptoms can vary widely from person to person, and making an accurate diagnosis often requires a thorough and nuanced assessment.
This is a binary classification problem related with Autistic Spectrum Disorder (ASD) screening in Adults. Given some attributes of a person, the model can predict whether the person would have a possibility to get ASD using different Supervised Learning Techniques.
